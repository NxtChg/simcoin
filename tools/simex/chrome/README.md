# Simex: Simcoin Browser Extension

This extension periodically fetches simxchg orders and displays the price either in satoshis or in USD per 1 million SIM.

In case of satoshis it displays top sell and buy orders.

In case of USD it displays the average price = (sell + buy) / 2.

It also fetches the latest posts from simtalk and displays red notification mark if there are new posts since you last clicked 'Visit forum'.
